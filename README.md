# ARNow

The project goal is to draw attention to **human rights violations** that still happen around the world by using **Augmented Reality**. Given how some issues can be distant from someone’s life and how easy it is to turn a blind eye, the project aims to get the user closer to the issue presented and provide a context of the situation. 

This is one of my first projects, created in April 2018. Unfortunately, I couldn’t convert it to a playground on time to submit it to WWDC18. A minor clean-up was done before publishing to GitHub. 

The project is inspired by Amnesty International’s 2013 campaign *“It’s not happening here, but it’s happening now”*. Albeit small, hopefully it can serve as a step forward towards change.
